Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

Prerequisites
What things you need to install the software and how to install them:

Java JDK 11 or later
JavaFX SDK
Git
Any IDE that supports Java (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse)

Installing
A step-by-step series of examples that tell you how to get a development environment running:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/nba-data-analysis-tool.git

2.Navigate to the project directory
cd nba-data-analysis-tool
3.Set up JavaFX
Ensure JavaFX is properly configured in your IDE. [Include specific instructions for IDE if necessary]

Running the Application
How to run the application on your local machine:

1.Compile the code
From the IDE, build the project using the built-in features, or use the following command if you are using a simple text editor:
javac -classpath path/to/javafx-sdk/lib --add-modules javafx.controls,javafx.fxml -d bin src/*.java

2.Run the application
From the IDE, you can run the application directly, or use the following command:
java --module-path path/to/javafx-sdk/lib --add-modules javafx.controls,javafx.fxml -cp bin Main
Replace path/to/javafx-sdk/lib with the actual path to your JavaFX lib folder.
